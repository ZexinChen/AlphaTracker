# 03 Tracking UI and Clustering UI

This interface is browser-based. We recommend using `Google Chrome` as the browser. 

Pre-installed Python3 is required since this package includes Python scripts.


### Installation 

Download and unzip the file.

### Running

Run `python server.py` in command window in the unzipped folder. A window should appear in the user's browser. Then click `html/`. From there, select a program you want to run. `cluster.html` is the Cluster UI and `curate.html` is the Tracking UI.

## Tracking UI


### Import data


- Click the first `Click Here` button to upload the track result JSON file. For example, [alphapose-results-forvis-tracked.json](../Tracking/AlphaTracker/track_result/alphapose-results-forvis-tracked.json)

- Click the second `Click Here`button to upload the original video. For example, [demo.mp4](../Tracking/AlphaTracker/data/demo.mp4)

- Specify the frame rate of the imported video. *The default frame rate value is* `25.0`.

    <img src = "media/1.png" width = "400">

### User interface

The functions of each element in the toolbar is explained by the numerical order shown in the figure.

#### I. Navigation Bar

    - 1.1 Tracking: Link to the Curate UI.
    - 1.2 Behavior: Link to the Cluster UI.
    - 1.3 Help: Link to the Operation Manual.
    - 1.4 Export: Saves the current clip information as a local `.json` file.
    - 1.5 New Session: Prompts user to import new files and start a new session. **Beware:** If the user chooses to create a new session, all unsaved progress will be lost.
    - 1.6 Undo Button
    - 1.7 Redo Button

#### II. Operation Area
    - 2.1 Video Player: Dots of different color groups represents skeletal points of an individual identity. Such dots can be directly interacted with by simply dragging with the cursor to a new location.
    - 2.2 Jump To: Jump to a specific frame of the video.
    - 2.3 Curate: Curates an interval designated by function 3.5.
    - 2.4 Reassign Identity
    - 2.5 Operation Log
    - 2.6 Real-time Strip Line Update On/Off: Due to existing play-back performance issues of the CanvasJS API, the real-time strip line update is by default set to off. The action of turning on real-time update while working with long videos is strongly discouraged since it will slow down your playback perfomance.

####  III. Toolbar
    - 3.1 Play Button
    - 3.2 Time/Frame Position
    - 3.3 Frame Control: By clicking the corresponding button, the user can fast forward/roll back the video by a single frame.
    - 3.4 Second Control: By clicking the corresponding button, the user can fast forward/roll back the video by a single second.
    - 3.5 Set Interval: IN button designates the start of the interval while the OUT button designates the end.

##  Cluster UI

### Import Data
To  import data from Alphatracker clustering, follow the instructions shown on corresponding pop-ups.

- Step 1:  Upload the JSON file that contains the clip information. For example, [clips_info.json](../BehavioralClustering/data_for_ui_1/clips_info.json)

    <img src = "media/4.png" width = 400>


- Step 2: Click the `Import` button and upload the original video. Then specify the frame rate of the imported video. *The default frame rate value is* `30`.

    <img src = "media/5.png" width = 400>


- Step 3: Upload the JSON file that contains the cluster tree information. For example, [Z_all_twoMice.json](../BehavioralClustering/data_for_ui_1/Z_all_twoMice.json)

    <img src = "media/6.png" width = 400>
